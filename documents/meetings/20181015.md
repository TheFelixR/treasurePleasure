## Discussion items (35 min)

- Known bugs
  - We have a few known bugs that affect the entire project.
  
- How to follow the correct pattern.
  - Is it correct to use the "throw exception" that we are currently using?
    Maybe we should use booleans instead or should we creat our own error class that handles everything the way we want?
    
  
- Map class/Settings fil
  - We have to much data in our inital model class, should we refactor this?
  
- Unit tests
  - The unit test for the top model will have its own test file. Might refactor this later.
    We have a few bugs in our app that we are missing tests for.
    Hopefully the tests will highlight where the bugs are.
  
- Fix map ux
  - Move the backpack button. Is the opacity correct? Should we remove streetnames? Should we have outzoom constraints?General fixes, to make it look nice.
  
- Marker bug (Dont go to marker when clicked)
  - Dont get moved to marked when its clicked. And null pointer bugg when "taken".

  
- All "global" variables should be edited and viewd from the same place (settings file)
  - This good idea (look at previous point in meeting).
  
- Gitinspector, are we up to date?
  - We looked at what gitinspector produced

- Furthur inspection on the mandatory things we have left (RAD, SDD, team grading etc..).
